# Simulate Smart Pot
At this project hardware and software requiered for a smart pot are designed. It is possible to connect to the proposed pot by Bluetooth. Consequently it is possible to know about state of the pot.
Features of each pot:
- Temperature
- Moisture
- Humidity

Whenever the moisture of the soil decreas, automatically waters the pot. It is also possible to add new pot into the application; therefor the use can manage any pot he has.
